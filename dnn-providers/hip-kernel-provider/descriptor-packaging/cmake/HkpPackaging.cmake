# hkp_wire_demo(<source_root> <arches> <hipcc> <kpack_python> <stage_root>)
#   Wire the same compile -> prune -> pack DAG as hkp_wire_production, then a
#   second, cheap step that copies the packed tree into the build tree's staged
#   descriptor directory. Two differences, both deliberate:
#
#   * No install() of any kind. The artifact exists so an integration ctest has a
#     real .kpack to load; it is not shipped surface.
#   * Missing hipcc warns and skips instead of failing. A release that silently
#     ships nothing is worse than a failed build, which is why production is
#     fatal -- but a test fixture must never break a developer's build. The test
#     GTEST_SKIP()s when the artifact is absent.
#
#   The two steps are separate custom commands on purpose. The pack step is
#   expensive and keyed on the authored sources; the copy step is keyed on a
#   stamp placed INSIDE stage_root, which hip-kernel-provider/CMakeLists.txt
#   wipes with file(REMOVE_RECURSE) once per configure. The wipe therefore takes
#   the stamp with it and the next build re-copies -- a stamp outside stage_root
#   would leave the tree wiped and the copy skipped, which looks exactly like
#   "packaging did not run".
#
#   The packer's <arch>/ + kpack/ layout is copied through verbatim: `library` on
#   a packed UKD is relative to the directory of the descriptor that declared it,
#   so flattening the tree breaks resolution at dispatch time with an error that
#   points at the loader rather than at this function.

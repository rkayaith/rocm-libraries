# hkp_wire_demo(<source_root> <arches> <hipcc> <kpack_python> <stage_root>)
#   Wire the same compile -> prune -> pack DAG as hkp_wire_production, then a
#   second, cheap step that copies the packed tree into the build tree's staged
#   descriptor directory. Two differences, both deliberate:
#
#   * No install() of any kind. The artifact exists so an integration ctest has a
#     real .kpack to load; it is not shipped surface.
#   * Missing hipcc warns and skips instead of failing. A release that silently
#     ships nothing is worse than a failed build, which is why production is
#     fatal -- but a test fixture must never break a developer's build. The test
#     GTEST_SKIP()s when the artifact is absent.
#
#   The two steps are separate custom commands on purpose. The pack step is
#   expensive and keyed on the authored sources; the copy step is keyed on a
#   stamp placed INSIDE stage_root, which hip-kernel-provider/CMakeLists.txt
#   wipes with file(REMOVE_RECURSE) once per configure. The wipe therefore takes
#   the stamp with it and the next build re-copies -- a stamp outside stage_root
#   would leave the tree wiped and the copy skipped, which looks exactly like
#   "packaging did not run".
#
#   The packer's <arch>/ + kpack/ layout is copied through verbatim: `library` on
#   a packed UKD is relative to the directory of the descriptor that declared it,
#   so flattening the tree breaks resolution at dispatch time with an error that
#   points at the loader rather than at this function.

# hkp_probe_comgr_resolvable(<out_ok> <out_detail>)
#   Configure-time gate for the rocKE producer, scoped to what is knowable at
#   configure time.
#
#   An earlier version imported `rocke, kernels` from the SOURCE tree under the
#   base interpreter. That validated a different mechanism than the build uses
#   (the build imports from wheels installed in the hkp venv), so it could pass
#   and the build then fail. The import check now runs where it belongs -- in
#   the provisioned venv, as the last step of hkp_rocke_wheel_python_interp --
#   because neither the venv nor the wheels exist until the build runs.
#
#   Scope caveat, measured: rocKE treats ROCKE_COMGR_LIB as a *candidate*, not
#   an assertion (`runtime/comgr.py:66` -- `_candidate_lib_paths` iterates and
#   the first loadable path wins). A bogus override therefore falls through to
#   the system comgr and this probe still reports success. That is rocKE's
#   resolution policy, not something to paper over here, and the probe's actual
#   question -- "can this machine lower a kernel at all" -- is still answered
#   correctly. Provenance (Phase 5.1) records the comgr that was really used,
#   which is the right place to catch a wrong-but-loadable library.
#
#   What IS knowable at configure time is whether comgr can be resolved at all,
#   and that is the common misconfiguration. Probing it here fails fast with a
#   readable message instead of deep in a build. The probe reads the resolver
#   from the source tree deliberately: it is asking about the machine's comgr,

# hkp_rocke_wheel_python_interp(<out_interp> <wheel_stamp>)
#   Provision a build-local interpreter carrying the rocke + rocke_library
#   wheels (built by the rocke-wheels target, which requires
#   HIPKERNELPROVIDER_ENABLE_ROCKE). The production tool imports rocke/kernels
#   from these installed wheels rather than the editable dev venv. The venv
#   interpreter is an add_custom_command OUTPUT so the production command can
#   depend on it for build ordering.
#
#   The venv is HERMETIC:
#     - no --system-site-packages: the dev venv inherits it to pick up the
#       system ROCm torch, but torch is not a build dependency. Inheriting the
#       system environment is how a build silently starts depending on whatever
#       happens to be installed on the machine.
#     - no `pip install --upgrade pip`: unconditional network access on every
#       provisioning run, to install two local files.
#     - --no-index: hermeticity enforced by the build rather than assumed.
#     - --no-deps: rocke declares numpy>=1.24 and rocke-library declares rocke.
#       Verified that the whole build path -- import rocke, import kernels,
#       build_attention_dense, and the comgr entry rocke.helpers.compile_kernel
#       -- works with neither installed; numpy is imported only by examples/,
#       heuristics/, benchmark/ and runtime/, which lowering never touches. The
#       dependency goes deliberately unsatisfied: nothing vendored, nothing
#       fetched. Should a future kernel import numpy at build time, the failure
#       is a loud ImportError naming the module rather than a silent pull from
#       an index.
#     - --force-reinstall: pip treats a same-name/same-version wheel as already
#       satisfied and leaves the OLD bytes in place. Since the version never
#       bumps, this flag is what makes a changed wheel actually land.
#
#   Depends on the wheel digest stamp, not the wheels, so a byte-identical
#   rebuild does not reprovision.
#
#   The rocke import check runs HERE, as the last step, rather than at configure
#   time: the venv and the wheels are both add_custom_command outputs that do
#   not exist until the build runs, so there is nothing to probe at configure
#   time. Running it in the provisioned venv also means it validates exactly
#   what the pack step will import, which the configure-time source-tree probe
#   did not.

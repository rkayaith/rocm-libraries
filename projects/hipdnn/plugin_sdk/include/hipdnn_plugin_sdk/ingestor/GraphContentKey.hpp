/// The graph half of a winner-cache key: content, never identity.
///
/// # What "equal" means here
///
/// This type defines one specific equivalence relation: **two graphs are equal when a
/// kernel measurement taken on one is a valid measurement for the other.** It is
/// deliberately coarser than "these are the same request" and deliberately finer than
/// "these compute the same thing". Everything below follows from that single question,
/// and any future change to the excluded set must answer it: *would a benchmark result
/// transfer?*
///
/// # Two jobs, split
///
/// Conflating them is what makes a content key expensive:
///
///  - `hash` narrows the lookup to a bucket. It may be lossy.
///  - `logicallyEqual` decides the match.
///
/// Both come from `cachekey_generated.h`, generated from `graph.fbs`, so a new schema
/// field is hashed and compared the day it is added -- the policy is opt-out. Both read
/// the buffer in place: no `UnPack`, no allocation, no reflection.
///
/// A hash match with differing content is therefore a miss, not a wrong kernel.
///
/// # The excluded fields, and why each transfers
///
/// Exclusion lives on the field in `graph.fbs`, as `(cache_ignore)`, next to the comment
/// explaining what the field means. Nothing here re-states the list, and nothing has to
/// remember to skip anything:
///
///  - `id` -- minted per finalize by `generateUuidV4()`, so it differs on every run of
///    the same program. Including it would make every lookup a miss and defeat the cache
///    outright.
///  - `preferred_engine_id` -- names which engine the caller would like to handle the
///    graph. It selects *who* runs the computation, never *what* is computed, and by the
///    time this engine is building a plan the preference has already been honoured or
///    not. Two callers wanting the same computation from different engines still measure
///    the same kernels.
///  - `is_override_shape_enabled` -- permits shapes to be overridden; it does not change
///    them. The tensor dims and strides in this same graph are the shapes that will
///    actually run, and they are compared in full. So the flag alters what the caller is
///    *allowed* to do later, never the geometry a kernel was timed against -- a
///    measurement transfers across it unchanged.
///  - `min_required_engine_api_version` -- derived, never independent content: stamped
///    from `computeMinimumEnginePluginApiVersion(...)`. Comparing it would silently
///    undo the `is_override_shape_enabled` exclusion above, since that flag alone moves
///    the stamped version. Its content-bearing inputs -- pass-by-value, ragged offsets,
///    alignment -- are each compared directly on the `TensorAttributes` that carry them.
///  - the `name` on the graph, each node and each tensor -- labels for humans. Two
///    identically-shaped graphs run the same kernels whatever they are called.
///
/// Everything else is compared, including tensor dims and strides, every node's
/// attributes, and all three graph-level data types -- each of those genuinely changes
/// what a kernel does, so a measurement does not transfer across them.
///
/// # Cost
///
/// One contiguous copy of the serialized graph per key, because a cached record outlives

/// the wire format itself -- no per-node allocation, and the comparison reads them
